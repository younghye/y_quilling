        Hi there, My name is Younghye. I was born and grew up in Korea. I used
        to be dog groomer for few years in Korea, then I went to Japan to study
        dog grooming and training. However, instead, I became interested in IT
        and started studying programming at university. I loved coding. Breaking
        down complex problems into smaller pieces and solve the problem for few
        hours or days. Finally when I saw the code actually worked, I felt a
        sense of accomplishment. After university, I worked as web developer and
        enjoyed it a lot. <br />
        <br /> After 7 years, I moved to New Zealand for the nature and better
        lifestyle. While here, I met my husband. Since then, I’ve been a full
        time mum with 2 children, as my kids got older I had more spare time and
        one day I saw a quilling video online, I thought it looked interesting.
        What is Quilling? It’s where you get strips of paper that are rolled,
        shaped and glued together to create decorative designs. It looked very
        simple at first, but finished pieces were amazing. <br />
        <br />
        During the lockdowns for COVID, I wanted to have some time just for
        myself when the kids were asleep. So, I started learning quilling by
        YouTube, I found it very relaxing and it made me happy to find something
        I enjoyed and was good at. I’ve worked on different types of quilling,
        animals, landscapes, abstracts... Specially I like animals/pets as
        subjects, it takes a lot of time and patience to bring out the
        liveliness of the subject, but when I see the results, it is so great.
        Just like I felt when I was programming. The best part is seeing
        people's joy when they receive my work.
